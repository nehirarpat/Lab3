# Load Datasets

# Missing Data
```{r}

#Listwise deletion

#pair wise deletion will only be used when you run the actual analysis using "na.rm = TRUE"

```

# Recode Variables: Changing Numeric Values to Characters
```{r}

lab3data %>% count(Gender)

#Solution 1
lab3data<- lab3data%>%
  mutate_at(c('Gender'),funs(str_replace(., "1", "Male")))

#Solution 2

#lab3data$Gender<-recode(lab3data$Gender, '1' = 'X', '2' = 'Y')


#Now recode 2 into Female

lab3data<- lab3data%>%

```{r}

#check to see if the recoding was successful
lab3data %>% count(RSE2_R)

#Now do the same for the other items (5,6,8,9)

lab3data$RSE5_R <- 5 - lab3data$RSE5

# Create Composites
```{r}

#Depending on the scale, sometimes you need to average across the items, other times you might need to sum 


#Fill in the items
lab3data <- lab3data %>%
  mutate(RSE = rowMeans(cbind(RSE1, RSE2_R, RSE3, RSE4, RSE5_R, RSE6_R, RSE7, RSE8_R, RSE9_R, RSE10)))

#Create another composite for SWL, but this time use rowSums
lab3data <- lab3data %>%
  mutate(SWL = rowSums(cbind(SWL1, SWL2, SWL3, SWL4, SWL5)))

```


# Get Summary Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
lab3data %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(mean_RSE    = mean(RSE),
      mean_SWL    = mean(SWL),
      std_dev_RSE = sd(RSE),
      std_dev_SWL = sd(SWL),
      corr_RSE_SWL  = cor(RSE, SWL)
    )

# Q1: Descrptively, which group has a higher self-esteem? What about life satisfaction? Is the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for males or for females? 

Males have higher self-esteem (3.121429 > 2.983448) and females have higher life satisfaction (16.28966	> 16.24675), although the difference is pretty small (unknown whether it is statistically significant). Based on the correlation calculated, the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction is stronger for males.


# Visualization of Data Distribution
```{r}

lab3data<- lab3data %>%
  drop_na(Gender)


ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = RSE)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_simpsons() + theme_modern()

#Create a plot for SWL by Gender with a different color palette
ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = SWL)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_futurama() + theme_modern()

```

# Q2: What you can tell from looking at a violin plot? What you cannot tell? What inferences you can make based on the two violin plots? 

A violin plot helps  visualize the distribution, density, and variability of data. It can indicate skewness and show how data points are spread out across the range. You cannot see exact data points, outliers/patterns, or sample size. We can see that both RSE plots are left tailed with the male plot having two modalities. For SWL plot (also left tailed), we can see that the distribution for males and females are pretty similar, so we cannot tell whether difference between the means are significant or not without a statistical test.
